## Project Description

This is a mongoDB and Express back end social network API application.

* When a user enters `npm run dev` in the command line, then the server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.

* When the user opens API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts, then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

* When they test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, they are able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database

* When they open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.

* Users can also test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia, and successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list.
